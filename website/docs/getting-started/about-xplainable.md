# About Xplainable

:::info What is Xplainable?
**Xplainable** is a transparent machine learning package that provides real-time explainability without sacrificing performance. It bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability through novel algorithms designed specifically for complete transparency.
:::

## Overview

Xplainable is a Python package that leverages explainable machine learning for fully transparent machine learning and advanced data optimization in production systems. Unlike traditional black-box models, xplainable provides **real-time explainability** without needing surrogate models like SHAP or LIME.

### Performance Without Compromise

| Feature | Traditional ML | Xplainable |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ High |
| **Explainability** | ‚ùå Post-hoc only | ‚úÖ Real-time |
| **Speed** | ‚ö° Fast training | ‚ö° Fast + rapid refitting |
| **Deployment** | üîß Complex | üöÄ One-click |
| **Collaboration** | üìù Code-only | üë• GUI + API |

### Novel Algorithms

Xplainable introduces several breakthrough concepts:

1. **Feature-wise Ensemble**: Each feature gets its own decision tree, optimized for information gain
