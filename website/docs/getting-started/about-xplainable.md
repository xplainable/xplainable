# About Xplainable

:::info What is Xplainable?
**Xplainable** is a transparent machine learning package that provides real-time explainability without sacrificing performance. It bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability through novel algorithms designed specifically for complete transparency.
:::

## Overview

Xplainable is a Python package that leverages explainable machine learning for fully transparent machine learning and advanced data optimization in production systems. Unlike traditional black-box models, xplainable provides **real-time explainability** without needing surrogate models like SHAP or LIME.
