# FICO Explainable ML: HELOC


## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we'll use Xplainable's platform to analyze the FICO Home Equity
Line of Credit (HELOC) dataset. This dataset is commonly used to predict credit risk,
helping to identify borrowers who may be at risk of defaulting on their line of credit.

We'll go step-by-step through Xplainable's features, starting with data preprocessing,
moving on to model training, and finally, interpreting the results. The goal is to show
how Xplainable can simplify the process of building and understanding machine learning
models, providing clear insights without the need for complex coding or deep statistical
knowledge. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll see how Xplainable can help you
quickly draw meaningful conclusions from the FICO HELOC dataset.


# Install and import relevant packages


```python
!pip install xplainable
!pip install altair==5.4.1 #Upgrade this to work in Google Colab

### Seperate data into target (y) and features (x)


```python
y = data['RiskPerformance']
x = data.drop('RiskPerformance',axis=1)
```

### Create test and train datasets


```python
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x,y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)
```

# 2. Model Optimisation

Xplainable's `XParamOptimiser `fine-tunes the hyperparameters of our model. This
produces the most optimal parameters that will result in the best model performance.


```python
y_train_df = pd.Series(y_train)

optimiser = XParamOptimiser(metric='f1-score',n_trials=300, n_folds=2, early_stopping=150)
params = optimiser.optimise(x_train, y_train_df)
```

## 3. Model Training

The `XClassifier` is trained on the dataset, with the optimised parameters.


```python
model = XClassifier(**params)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

<CellOutput>
{`<xplainable.core.ml.classification.XClassifier at 0x108e252a0>`}
</CellOutput>

# 4. Explaining and Interpreting the Model

Following training, the `model.explain()` method is called to generate insights into the
model's decision-making process. This step is crucial for understanding the factors that
influence the model's predictions and ensuring that the model's behaviour is transparent
and explainable.


```python
model.explain()
```

## Analysing Feature Importances and Contributions

Click on the bars to see the importances and contributions of each variable.

### Feature Importances

The relative significance of each feature (or input variable) in making predictions. It
indicates how much each feature contributes to the model’s predictions, with higher
values implying greater influence.

## Feature Significance

The effect of each feature on individual predictions. For instance, in this model,
feature contributions would show how each feature (like the net fraction of trades
revolving burden) affects the predicted risk estimate for a particular applicant.


# 5. Saving a model to Xplainable's app


In this step, we first create a unique identifier for our HELOC risk prediction model
using client.create_model_id. This identifier, referred to as model_id, represents the
newly created model that predicts the likelihood of applicants defaulting on their line
of credit. After creating this model identifier, we generate a specific version of the
model using client.create_model_version, passing in our training data. The resulting
version_id represents this particular iteration of our model, allowing us to track and
manage different versions systematically.


Creat an API key in the Xplainable platform

```python
client = xplainable_client.Client(
    api_key="f6eaf63f-598e-4dfc-9ebd-a343386d1905",
    hostname="https://xplainable-api-uat-45xyq.ondigitalocean.app"
)
```

```python
# Create a model
model_id = client.create_model_id(
    model,
    model_name="HELOC",
    model_description="Predicting applicant risk estimates"
)
# Create a version for that model
version_id = client.create_model_version(model, model_id, x_train, y_train)
```

## Xplainable App

As you can see in the screenshot, now the model has been saved to Xplainable's webapp,
allowing yourself and other members in your organisation to visually analyse the model.

# 6. Deployments


The code block illustrates the deployment of our churn prediction model using the
xp.client.deploy function. The deployment process involves specifying the hostname of
the server where the model will be hosted, as well as the unique model_id and version_id
that we obtained in the previous steps. This step effectively activates the model's
endpoint, allowing it to receive and process prediction requests. The output confirms
the deployment with a deployment_id, indicating the model's current status as
'inactive', its location, and the endpoint URL where it can be accessed for xplainable
deployments.


```python
deployment = client.deploy(
    hostname="https://inference.xplainable.io",
    model_id=model_id,
    version_id=version_id
)
```

```python
deployment
```

<CellOutput>
{`{'deployment_id': 'Du526MrksjGMu4Np',
 'status': 'inactive',
 'location': 'syd',
 'endpoint': 'https://inference.xplainable.io/v1/predict'}`}
</CellOutput>

### Testing the Deployment programatically

This section demonstrates the steps taken to programmatically test a deployed model.
These steps are essential for validating that the model's deployment is functional and
ready to process incoming prediction requests.


1. **Activating the Deployment:** The model deployment is activated using
   `xp.client.activate_deployment`, which changes the deployment status to active,
   allowing it to accept prediction requests.


```python
client.activate_deployment(deployment['deployment_id'])
```

<CellOutput>
{`{'message': 'activated deployment'}`}
</CellOutput>

2. **Creating a Deployment Key:** A deployment key is generated with
   `xp.client.generate_deploy_key`. This key is required to authenticate and make secure
   requests to the deployed model.


```python
deploy_key = client.generate_deploy_key('for testing', deployment['deployment_id'], 7)
```

3. **Generating Example Payload:** An example payload for a deployment request is
   generated by `xp.client.generate_example_deployment_payload`. This payload mimics the
   input data structure the model expects when making predictions.


```python
#Set the option to highlight multiple ways of creating data
option = 1
```

```python
if option == 1:
    body = client.generate_example_deployment_payload(deployment['deployment_id'])
else:
    body = json.loads(df.drop(columns=["RiskPerformance"]).sample(1).to_json(orient="records"))
    # body[0]["Gender"] = None #<- Won't require this line the next release of xplainable
```

```python
body
```

<CellOutput>
{`[{'ExternalRiskEstimate': 66.0,
  'MSinceOldestTradeOpen': 322.0,
  'MSinceMostRecentTradeOpen': None,

  'NumInstallTradesWBalance': None,
  'NumBank2NatlTradesWHighUtilization': None,
  'PercentTradesWBalance': None}]`}
</CellOutput>

4. **Making a Prediction Request:** A POST request is made to the model's prediction
   endpoint with the example payload. The model processes the input data and returns a
   prediction response, which includes the predicted class (e.g., 'No' for no churn) and
   the prediction probabilities for each class.


```python
deploy_key['deploy_key']
```

<CellOutput>
{`'f2a38982-c4f2-4114-b8ce-d71e37019f5f'`}
</CellOutput>

```python
response = requests.post(
    url="https://inference.xplainable.io/v1/predict",
    headers={'api_key': deploy_key['deploy_key']},
    json=body
)

value = response.json()

## SaaS Deployment Info

The SaaS application interface displayed above mirrors the operations performed
programmatically in the earlier steps. It displays a dashboard for managing the 'Telco
Customer Churn' model, facilitating a range of actions from deployment to testing, all
within a user-friendly web interface. This makes it accessible even to non-technical
users who prefer to manage model deployments and monitor performance through a graphical
interface rather than code. Features like the deployment checklist, example payload, and
prediction response are all integrated into the application, ensuring that users have
full control and visibility over the deployment lifecycle and model interactions.
