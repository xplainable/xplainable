# Lead Scoring Prediction


An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.
On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their
website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once
these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for
the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email
address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also
gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the
sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the
leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education
is around 30%.

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor.
For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are
converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most
potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of
leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more
on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

There are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them
come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture
the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly
communicating, etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.

X Education wants to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most
likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model
wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers
with higher lead score h have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower
lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark
of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Create Preprocessor ID to persist to Xplainable Cloud


```python

preprocessor_id, version_id = client.preprocessing.create_preprocessor(
    preprocessor_name="Lead Scoring Preprocessing",
    preprocessor_description="Predicting the Likelihood of a Lead Converting",
    pipeline=pipeline,
    df=df
)
```

```python
preprocessor_id, version_id
```

<CellOutput>
{`('1IkLdZXzAEZfPJpE', '2yDjTGvCgVk0kmhE')`}
</CellOutput>

### Loading the Preprocessor steps

Use the api to load pre-existing preprocessor steps from the xplainable cloud and
transform data inplace.


```python

pp_cloud = client.preprocessing.load_preprocessor(
    version_id,
    preprocessor_id,
)
```

```python
pp_cloud.stages
```

<CellOutput>
{`[{'feature': '__dataset__',
  'name': 'DropCols',
  'transformer': <xplainable.preprocessing.transformers.dataset.DropCols at 0x16fbe7e80>}]`}
</CellOutput>

```python
df_transformed_cloud = pp_cloud.transform(df)

```

```python
df_transformed_cloud
```

### Create Train/Test split for model training validation


```python
X, y = df_transformed.drop(columns=['Converted']), df['Converted']

#Optional if you want to use the cloud preprocessor
# X, y = df_transformed_cloud.drop(columns=['Converted']), df_transformed_cloud['Converted']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
     X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
```

## 2. Model Optimisation

The `XParamOptimiser` is utilised to fine-tune the hyperparameters of our model. This
process searches for the optimal parameters that will yield the best model performance,
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.


```python
opt = XParamOptimiser()
params = opt.optimise(X_train, y_train)
```

<CellOutput>
{`100%|██████████| 30/30 [00:03<00:00,  8.59trial/s, best loss: -0.8594330347239172]`}
</CellOutput>

## 3. Model Training

With the optimised parameters obtained, the `XClassifier` is trained on the dataset.
This classifier undergoes a fitting process with the training data, ensuring that it
learns the underlying patterns and can make accurate predictions.


```python
model = XClassifier(**params)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<CellOutput>
{`<xplainable.core.ml.classification.XClassifier at 0x28fd6aef0>`}
</CellOutput>

## 4. Model Interpretability and Explainability

Following training, the `model.explain()` method is called to generate insights into the
model's decision-making process. This step is crucial for understanding the factors that
influence the model's predictions and ensuring that the model's behaviour is transparent
and explainable.


```python
model.explain()
```

The visualization displays feature importance and contribution analysis for the lead
scoring prediction model.

The 'Feature Importances' chart ranks features by their ability to predict lead
conversion probability. Key factors influencing lead scoring typically include
engagement metrics, demographic information, and behavioral patterns from the lead's
interactions.

The 'Contributions' chart shows how specific feature values impact individual
predictions, helping understand what drives lead qualification decisions and enabling
sales teams to prioritize high-quality prospects.


## 5. Model Persisting

In this step, we first create a unique identifier for our churn prediction model using
`client.create_model_id`. This identifier, shown as `model_id`, represents the newly
instantiated model which predicts the likelihood of customers leaving within the next
month. Following this, we generate a specific version of the model with
`client.create_model_version`, passing in our training data. The output `version_id`
represents this particular iteration of our model, allowing us to track and manage
different versions systematically.


```python
# Create a model
model_id, version_id = client.models.create_model(
    model=model,
    model_name="Lead Scoring",
    model_description="Predicting the likelihood of a lead converting",
    x=X_train,
    y=y_train
)
```

</CellOutput>

## 6. Model Deployment


The code block illustrates the deployment of our churn prediction model using the
`client.deploy` function. The deployment process involves specifying the `hostname` of
the server where the model will be hosted, as well as the unique `model_id` and
`version_id` that we obtained in the previous steps. This step effectively activates the
model's endpoint, allowing it to receive and process prediction requests. The output
confirms the deployment with a `deployment_id`, indicating the model's current `status`
as 'inactive', its `location`, and the `endpoint` URL where it can be accessed for
xplainable deployments.


```python
if model_id and version_id:
    try:
        deployment_response = client.deployments.deploy(
            model_version_id=version_id #<- Use version id produced above
        )
        deployment_id = deployment_response.deployment_id
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error deploying model: {e}")
        deployment_id = None
else:
    deployment_id = None
```

### Testing the Deployment programatically

This section demonstrates the steps taken to programmatically test a deployed model.
These steps are essential for validating that the model's deployment is functional and
ready to process incoming prediction requests.


1. **Activating the Deployment:** The model deployment is activated using
   `client.activate_deployment`, which changes the deployment status to active, allowing
   it to accept prediction requests.


```python
if deployment_id:
    try:
        client.deployments.activate_deployment(deployment_id=deployment_id)
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error activating deployment: {e}")
else:
    print("Deployment ID not available")
```

2. **Creating a Deployment Key:** A deployment key is generated with
   `xp.client.generate_deploy_key`. This key is required to authenticate and make secure
   requests to the deployed model.


```python
if deployment_id:
    try:
        deploy_key = client.deployments.generate_deploy_key(
            deployment_id=deployment_id, 
            description='API key for Lead Scoring Prediction',
            days_until_expiry=30
        )
        print(f"Deploy key created: {str(deploy_key)}")
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error generating deploy key: {e}")
        deploy_key = None
else:
    deploy_key = None
```

<CellOutput>
{`Deploy key created: 3272a7e2-9c28-4c8d-a3b8-cc70d2168619`}
</CellOutput>

3. **Generating Example Payload:** An example payload for a deployment request is
   generated by `client.generate_example_deployment_payload`. This payload mimics the
   input data structure the model expects when making predictions.


```python
#Set the option to highlight multiple ways of creating data
option = 2
```

```python
df_transformed.columns
```

<CellOutput>
{`Index(['Lead Origin', 'Lead Source', 'Do Not Email', 'Do Not Call',
       'Converted', 'TotalVisits', 'Total Time Spent on Website',
       'Page Views Per Visit', 'Last Activity', 'Specialization',
       'How did you hear about X Education', 'What is your current occupation',
       'What matters most to you in choosing a course', 'Search', 'Magazine',
       'Newspaper Article', 'X Education Forums', 'Newspaper',
       'Digital Advertisement', 'Through Recommendations',
       'Receive More Updates About Our Courses', 'Lead Quality',
       'Update me on Supply Chain Content', 'Get updates on DM Content',
       'Lead Profile', 'City', 'Asymmetrique Activity Index',
       'Asymmetrique Profile Index', 'Asymmetrique Activity Score',
       'Asymmetrique Profile Score',
       'I agree to pay the amount through cheque',
       'A free copy of Mastering The Interview', 'Last Notable Activity'],
      dtype='object')`}
</CellOutput>

```python
if option == 1 and version_id:
    try:
        body = client.deployments.generate_example_deployment_payload(
            model_version_id=version_id
        )
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error generating example payload: {e}")
        body = []
else:
    body = json.loads(df_transformed.drop(columns=["Converted"]).sample(1).to_json(orient="records"))
    body[0]["Gender"] = None #<- Won't require this line the next release of xplainable
```

```python
body
```

<CellOutput>
{`[{'Lead Origin': 'API',
  'Lead Source': 'Olark Chat',

  'Gender': None}]`}
</CellOutput>

4. **Making a Prediction Request:** A POST request is made to the model's prediction
   endpoint with the example payload. The model processes the input data and returns a
   prediction response, which includes the predicted class (e.g., 'No' for no churn) and
   the prediction probabilities for each class.


```python
if deploy_key and body:
    response = requests.post(
        url="https://inference.xplainable.io/v1/predict",
        headers={'api_key': str(deploy_key)},
        json=body
    )

    value = response.json()
    print("Prediction result:", value)
else:
    print("Deploy key or body not available for prediction")
