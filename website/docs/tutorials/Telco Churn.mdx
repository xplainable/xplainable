### Create Preprocessor to Persist to Xplainable Cloud


```python
try:
    preprocessor_id, version_id = client.preprocessing.create_preprocessor(
        preprocessor_name="Telco Churn Preprocessing - v1.3.0 - New Client",
        preprocessor_description="Handling all preprocessing steps in the IBM Telco Churn Dataset",
        pipeline=pipeline,
        df=df
    )
except XplainableAPIError as e:
    print(f"Error creating preprocessor: {e}")
    preprocessor_id, version_id = None, None
```

### Loading the Preprocessor steps

Use the api to load pre-existing preprocessor steps from the xplainable cloud and
transform data inplace.


```python

pp_cloud = client.preprocessing.load_preprocessor(
    version_id,
    preprocessor_id
)

```

```python
pp_cloud.stages
```

<CellOutput>
{`[{'feature': '__dataset__',
  'name': 'ChangeCases',
  'transformer': <xplainable.preprocessing.transformers.dataset.ChangeCases at 0x29ffaa8c0>},
 {'feature': 'City',
  'name': 'Condense',
  'transformer': <xplainable.preprocessing.transformers.categorical.Condense at 0x29ffab130>},
 {'feature': 'Monthly Charges',
  'name': 'SetDType',
  'transformer': <xplainable.preprocessing.transformers.mixed.SetDType at 0x29ffaa620>},
 {'feature': '__dataset__',
  'name': 'DropCols',
  'transformer': <xplainable.preprocessing.transformers.dataset.DropCols at 0x29ffaa290>}]`}
</CellOutput>

```python
if pp_cloud:
    df_transformed_cloud = pp_cloud.transform(df)
else:
    print("Using local preprocessing pipeline")
    df_transformed_cloud = df_transformed.copy()
```

### Create Train/Test split for model training validation


```python
X, y = df_transformed.drop(columns=['Churn Label']), df['Churn Label']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
     X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
```

## 2. Model Optimisation

The `XParamOptimiser` is utilised to fine-tune the hyperparameters of our model. This
process searches for the optimal parameters that will yield the best model performance,
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.


```python
opt = XParamOptimiser()
params = opt.optimise(X_train, y_train)
```

<CellOutput>
{`100%|██████████| 30/30 [00:02<00:00, 11.17trial/s, best loss: -0.8268936134101414]`}
</CellOutput>

## 3. Model Training

With the optimised parameters obtained, the `XClassifier` is trained on the dataset.
This classifier undergoes a fitting process with the training data, ensuring that it
learns the underlying patterns and can make accurate predictions.


```python
model = XClassifier(**params)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<CellOutput>
{`<xplainable.core.ml.classification.XClassifier at 0x2a254dcf0>`}
</CellOutput>

## 4. Model Interpretability and Explainability

Following training, the `model.explain()` method is called to generate insights into the
model's decision-making process. This step is crucial for understanding the factors that
influence the model's predictions and ensuring that the model's behaviour is transparent
and explainable.


```python
model.explain()
```

The image displays two graphs related to a churn prediction model.

On the left is the 'Feature Importances' bar chart, which ranks the features by their
ability to predict customer churn. 'Tenure Months' has the highest importance,
confirming that the length of customer engagement is the most significant indicator of
churn likelihood. 'Monthly Charges' and 'Contract' follow, suggesting that financial and
contractual commitments are also influential in churn prediction.

The right graph is a 'Contributions' histogram, which quantifies the impact of a
specific feature's values on the prediction outcome. The red bars indicate that higher
values within the selected feature correspond to a decrease in the likelihood of churn,
whereas the green bars show that lower values increase this likelihood.

The placement of 'Gender' at the bottom of the 'Feature Importances' chart conclusively
indicates that the model does not consider gender a determinant in predicting churn,
thereby ensuring the model's impartiality regarding gender.


## 5. Model Persisting

In this step, we first create a unique identifier for our churn prediction model using
`client.create_model_id`. This identifier, shown as `model_id`, represents the newly
instantiated model which predicts the likelihood of customers leaving within the next
month. Following this, we generate a specific version of the model with
`client.create_model_version`, passing in our training data. The output `version_id`
represents this particular iteration of our model, allowing us to track and manage
different versions systematically.

## 6. Model Deployment


The code block illustrates the deployment of our churn prediction model using the
`xp.client.deploy` function. The deployment process involves specifying the `hostname`
of the server where the model will be hosted, as well as the unique `model_id` and
`version_id` that we obtained in the previous steps. This step effectively activates the
model's endpoint, allowing it to receive and process prediction requests. The output
confirms the deployment with a `deployment_id`, indicating the model's current `status`
as 'inactive', its `location`, and the `endpoint` URL where it can be accessed for
xplainable deployments.


```python
if model_id and version_id:
    try:
        deployment_response = client.deployments.deploy(
            model_version_id=version_id #<- Use version id produced above
        )
        deployment_id = deployment_response.deployment_id
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error deploying model: {e}")
        deployment_id = None
else:
    deployment_id = None
```

### Testing the Deployment programatically

This section demonstrates the steps taken to programmatically test a deployed model.
These steps are essential for validating that the model's deployment is functional and
ready to process incoming prediction requests.


1. **Activating the Deployment:** The model deployment is activated using
   `client.activate_deployment`, which changes the deployment status to active, allowing
   it to accept prediction requests.


```python
if deployment_id:
    try:
        client.deployments.activate_deployment(deployment_id=deployment_id)
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error activating deployment: {e}")
else:
    print("Deployment ID not available")
```

2. **Creating a Deployment Key:** A deployment key is generated with
   `client.generate_deploy_key`. This key is required to authenticate and make secure
   requests to the deployed model.


```python
if deployment_id:
    try:
        deploy_key = client.deployments.generate_deploy_key(
            deployment_id=deployment_id, 
            description='API key for Telco Churn',
            days_until_expiry=30
        )
        print(f"Deploy key created: {str(deploy_key)}")
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error generating deploy key: {e}")
        deploy_key = None
else:
    deploy_key = None
```

<CellOutput>
{`Deploy key created: 91a8009f-5672-4db0-b4c9-48d2d5d266d3`}
</CellOutput>

3. **Generating Example Payload:** An example payload for a deployment request is
   generated by `client.generate_example_deployment_payload`. This payload mimics the
   input data structure the model expects when making predictions.


```python
#Set the option to highlight multiple ways of creating data
option = 2
```

```python
if option == 1 and version_id:
    try:
        body = client.deployments.generate_example_deployment_payload(
            model_version_id=version_id
        )
    except XplainableAPIError as e:
        print(f"Error generating example payload: {e}")
        body = []
else:
    body = json.loads(df_transformed.drop(columns=["Churn Label"]).sample(1).to_json(orient="records"))
    body[0]["Gender"] = None #<- Won't require this line the next release of xplainable
```

```python
body
```

<CellOutput>
{`[{'City': 'long beach',
  'Gender': None,
  'Senior Citizen': 'yes',
  'Partner': 'yes',
  'Dependents': 'yes',
  'Tenure Months': 29,
  'Phone Service': 'no',
  'Multiple Lines': 'no phone service',
  'Internet Service': 'dsl',
  'Online Security': 'no',
  'Online Backup': 'yes',
  'Device Protection': 'yes',
  'Tech Support': 'no',
  'Streaming TV': 'no',
  'Streaming Movies': 'no',
  'Contract': 'month-to-month',
  'Paperless Billing': 'yes',
  'Payment Method': 'mailed check',
  'Monthly Charges': 35.65}]`}
</CellOutput>

4. **Making a Prediction Request:** A POST request is made to the model's prediction
   endpoint with the example payload. The model processes the input data and returns a
   prediction response, which includes the predicted class (e.g., 'No' for no churn) and
   the prediction probabilities for each class.


```python
if deploy_key and body:
    response = requests.post(
        url="https://inference.xplainable.io/v1/predict",
        headers={'api_key': str(deploy_key)},
        json=body
    )

    value = response.json()
    print("Prediction result:", value)
else:
    print("Deploy key or body not available for prediction")
```

<CellOutput>
{`Prediction result: [{'index': 0, 'id': None, 'partition': '__dataset__', 'score': 0.48342510393815447, 'proba': 0.17580469369235227, 'pred': 0, 'support': 280, 'breakdown': [{'feature': 'base_value', 'value': None, 'score': 0.2602797795676134}, {'feature': 'City', 'value': 'long beach', 'score': -0.004060534892893153}, {'feature': 'Gender', 'value': 'nan', 'score': 0.0}, {'feature': 'Senior Citizen', 'value': 'yes', 'score': 0.045826964522160306}, {'feature': 'Partner', 'value': 'yes', 'score': -0.006948709833072504}, {'feature': 'Dependents', 'value': 'yes', 'score': -0.01868614293728342}, {'feature': 'Tenure Months', 'value': '29', 'score': -0.005027155608567363}, {'feature': 'Phone Service', 'value': 'no', 'score': -0.003697016407864983}, {'feature': 'Multiple Lines', 'value': 'no phone service', 'score': -0.003697016407864983}, {'feature': 'Internet Service', 'value': 'dsl', 'score': -0.007278086066799008}, {'feature': 'Online Security', 'value': 'no', 'score': 0.050913948636735554}, {'feature': 'Online Backup', 'value': 'yes', 'score': -0.0046493037837984}, {'feature': 'Device Protection', 'value': 'yes', 'score': -0.003688961556125644}, {'feature': 'Tech Support', 'value': 'no', 'score': 0.04973117743014013}, {'feature': 'Streaming TV', 'value': 'no', 'score': 0.023936765852240336}, {'feature': 'Streaming Movies', 'value': 'no', 'score': 0.024447731368512055}, {'feature': 'Contract', 'value': 'month-to-month', 'score': 0.05457342511379243}, {'feature': 'Paperless Billing', 'value': 'yes', 'score': 0.024703763630477254}, {'feature': 'Payment Method', 'value': 'mailed check', 'score': -0.0062073345661475855}, {'feature': 'Monthly Charges', 'value': '35.65', 'score': 0.012951809876900066}]}]`}

## Rendering AI-Generated Reports in Markdown

When working with AI-generated reports, readability is key. Instead of printing raw
text, we can render the output directly as **Markdown** inside a Jupyter Notebook.

This allows us to use headings, lists, and other formatting styles, making the report
much easier to consume and present.


```python

report = client.gpt.generate_report(
    model_id=model_id,
    version_id=version_id,
    target_description="Customer churn likelihood (1 = will churn, 0 = will stay)",
    project_objective="Identify customers at risk of leaving to improve retention strategies",
    max_features=10,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(f"AI report generated!")
print(f"Report length: {len(report.report):,} characters")
```

```python
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

display(Markdown(report.body))
```
